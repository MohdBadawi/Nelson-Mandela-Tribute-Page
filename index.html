                    <h3>Here is a timeline of Nelson Mandela's life:</h3>
                    <ul style="text-align:left;">
                        <li><strong>1918</strong> Born in the village of Mvezo in the Transkei, now the Eastern Cape </li>
                        <li><strong>1956</strong> Along with 155 others, Mandela is accused of conspiring to overthrow the South African state by violent means and is charged with treason. After a four-year trial, the charges are dropped </li>
                        <li><strong>1960</strong> People in Sharpeville protest against restrictions on their freedom of movement. Police kill 69 people, including women and children, and a state of emergency is declared amid fears of retaliation. Later the same month, the ANC is banned, a state of emergency is imposed and Mandela is detained</li>
                        <li><strong>1963</strong> The Security Council adopted Resolution 181 calling upon all states to cease the sale and shipment of arms, ammunition and military vehicles to South Africa. The arms embargo was made mandatory on November 4 1977
                        <li><strong>1964</strong> Mandela and seven others are sentenced to life imprisonment for sabotage on Robben Island, off Cape Town</li> 
                        <li><strong>1985</strong> In January, President PW Botha offers Mandela conditional release from prison, which Mandela refuses. Later that year, Mandela initiates talks with the apartheid regime when he writes to Kobie Coetsee, minister of justice </li>
                        <li><strong>1990</strong> Mandela is released from prison, greeted by large crowds. That year, negotiations begin about the formation of a multiracial democracy in South Africa </li>
                        <li><strong>1993</strong> Mandela, along with South African president FW de Klerk, is jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for efforts to bring stability to South Africa. Accepting the award, Mandela says: <em>"We live with the hope that as she battles to remake herself, South Africa will be like a microcosm of the new world that is striving to be born."</em></li>
                        <li><strong>1994</strong> Inaugurated as first black president of a democratic South Africa. De Klerk becomes vice-president in his Government of National Unity. Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's deputy, takes over the day-to-day running of government, leaving Mandela free to promote the country around the world </li>
                        <li><strong>1999</strong> Steps down after one term as president; hands power to Mbeki who goes on to become president after the ANC wins the 1999 presidential election</li>
                        <li><strong>2004</strong> Mandela announces that he will be retiring from public life</li>
                        <li><strong>2013</strong> Mandela is admitted to hospital with lung infection</li>
                        <li><strong>2013</strong> Nelson Mandela dies</li>
                    </ul>
